                <p class="txt">
                    QBet Casino, as an information platform, provides reliable and complete information, also regarding
                    the risks associated with online games. This page has been developed to help you make informed
                    decisions, recognise risky behaviours, and indicate where to seek help in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧.
                    Our mission is to contribute to a safer online entertainment environment through the dissemination
                    of knowledge.

                <p class="txt">
                    Responsible gambling begins with awareness and proper preparation. Set in advance limits for both
                    time and money you wish to allocate to online entertainment. Always treat games as a form of
                    entertainment, never as a way to earn money or recoup losses. Plan regular breaks during sessions
                    and maintain a balance with other hobbies and responsibilities in your life. These are the basic
                    principles of healthy gaming habits.

                    Early recognition of warning signs is crucial for maintaining control. Pay attention to signs such
                    as: difficulty stopping, feeling the need to gamble more to achieve the same emotions, lying to
                    friends or family about time or money spent on gambling, financial problems or borrowing money to
                    gamble, and neglecting work, studies, or social contacts. Do you recognise one or more of these
                    signs in yourself or someone else? It is time to take action.

                <p class="txt">
                    There are persistent myths about gambling that can fuel risky behaviours. It is important to know
                    them:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Online gambling is not an investment:</strong> The platform always has a statistical
                        advantage in the long term. Gambling to make money is a dangerous mindset.</li>
                    <li><strong>No "sure" strategy exists:</strong> No tactic or system can overcome the randomness
                        (RNG) of fair slot games.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Chasing losses" thinking:</strong> Losses cannot be recouped by playing longer or more;
                        each round is independent. This concept is known as the "gambler's fallacy".</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p class="txt">
                    Many regulated online platforms in the UK offer users tools to manage their behaviour. Although
                    <strong>QBet Casino</strong> itself is not a gaming platform, we consider it essential that you are
                    aware of these possibilities. On reputable UK platforms, you can often use:

                <p class="txt">
                    Problematic gambling has a significant impact not only on the player themselves but also on their
                    immediate environment. As a family member, partner, or friend, it is important to recognise the
                    signs and know how to approach the person. Open, non-judgmental communication is the first step.
                    There are also specific support groups and helplines for loved ones in the United Kingdom.

                    If you notice that gambling is becoming a problem, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.
                    In the United Kingdom 🇬🇧, there are several trustworthy organisations that offer free and
                    anonymous help. The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) is the regulatory body and provides information.
                    For direct assistance and advice, you can turn to specialised institutions.

                <p class="txt">
                    By law, regulated platforms in the UK are required to implement strict age verification (18+). As an
                    information platform, <strong>QBet Casino</strong> emphasises the importance of this protection. We
                    encourage parents and guardians to talk to young people about the risks associated with online
                    gambling and to be vigilant regarding access to their payment methods.
